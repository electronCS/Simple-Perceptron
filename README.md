# Simple-Perceptron
An example of a simple perceptron, the basic building block of a neural network. 
The perceptron's is given a bunch of points, all divided by an invisible line. 
The perceptron is told which points lie on which side of the line; it's goal is to guess where the line is.
This perceptron contains 3 weights, one for the x variable, one for the y variable, and a bias term.
